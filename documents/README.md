#Lesson 10: Assignment

##Prompt:

###_Write what you learned about SEO & analytics (1-2 paragraphs)._

###_How you would ideally implement SEO on your site (for our purposes we will add some light metadata - this would be if you had plenty of time to fully implement the metadata that you'd like)._

SEO is a group of practices that may help your website get in front of more users online. The algorithms used by search engines are propriety and change often, so it is up to the community to decipher how best to leverage SEO for themselves. Some general guidelines would be as follows:

• Limit h1 tags to one per page. Use it to deliver the main purpose of your page.

• Have a relevant title in your head tag.

• Use heading tags judiciously and appropriately. Filling a page with heading tags or irrelevant hidden text will lower your SEO rank.

• Quality backlinks increase your SEO rank. Meaning, link to relevant sites and have relevant sites link to you.

• Including social tags may raise engagement, site visibility, and traffic.
• Results can be measured using KPI tools.

As SEO relates to my project, I would want to reevaluate the usage and contents of my heading tags. I would expand the options for and increase the number of social tags. And I would create more external links on the about page to other relevant resources.

Add a social page that links or embeds relevant social media accounts.
